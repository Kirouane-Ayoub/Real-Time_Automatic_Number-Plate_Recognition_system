Real-Time Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system is an advanced technology that combines the power of 
computer vision and deep learning to recognize and interpret license plate information from vehicles in real-time. 
This system is built using the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 object detection algorithm and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. 
The system can detect and read number plates from live video feeds or recorded footage from cameras, making it an ideal solution for traffic management,
law enforcement, and parking management applications. With its high accuracy, speed, and real-time capabilities, 
this system is changing the way number plate recognition is performed, making it more efficient and reliable than ever before.
